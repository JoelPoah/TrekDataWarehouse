select product_id from production.products where product_id not in(select product_id from Production.stocks)

// Performing a inner join will leave out the 8 products
select * from production.products p,Production.stocks s
where s.product_id = p.product_id

// Make sure to either use a left join or full outer join (do read up more to explain)
select * from production.products p
left join Production.stocks s ON p.product_id = s.product_id

select * from production.products p
full outer join Production.stocks s ON p.product_id = s.product_id

|| 

select * from production.stocks s
full outer join Production.products p ON p.product_id  = s.product_id

// ALSO IF DENORMALIZE GOT TO FILL IN NULL VALUES 
// for example
select * from production.stocks s
full outer join Production.products p ON p.product_id  = s.product_id
where p.product_id = 'RDB320'
